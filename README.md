# Paratii-Transcoder

**WORK IN PROGRESS**

This is the main implementation for the `paratii` transcoder and gateway.

## Dependencies

This requires [`ffmpeg`](https://www.ffmpeg.org/) to work. head over to the [download section](https://www.ffmpeg.org/download.html) and install the proper release for your system.

## Installation

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/Paratii-Video/transcoder.git
$ cd transcoder
$ npm Install

# for development
$ npm run dev

# in production
$ npm start

# Note: You can also use yarn. I'm not gonna judge :)
```

## Documentation

TODO , But take a look at `src/node.js` and follow along the jsdocs and you should be able to get around the code.

In the meantime, if you have any question, head to our [gitter dev channel](https://gitter.im/Paratii-Video/dev) and feel free to use the issues section aswell :)
